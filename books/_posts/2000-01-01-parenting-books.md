# Books on parenting

## [How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/1848123094)

This book comes highly recommended, and I can vouch for it myself. Having purchased the whole "How to talk" collection on the strength of the Hacker News recommendation, and have already been able to improve my interactions with my two year old.

The books are really aimed at kids three and up, with the original book focusing on school age children, there's also "How to talk" book for younger kids, teens, sibling rivalry and schooling. I'm looking forward to being able to apply the lessons from the entire series as my kids grow up.

My only criticism is would be the book feels padded by stories and repetition, however that helps drive the lessons home, and there's often a summary at the end of each chapter that contains all the vital information.

This book is so well loved that Hacker News also frequently recommends it for effecting communication [between adults](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27408120), and [at the office](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18019703)

## [Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004OA64Q6/)

This is a summary and exploration of studies that have shown how little influence parenting and parenting style have on the person your child will grow up to be. This doesn't mean don't bother trying to be a good parent, and of course objectively bad parenting _will_ have a negative impact on your child. It's more than being overly pushy or "tiger" parenting will not make your kid smarter or more successful.
