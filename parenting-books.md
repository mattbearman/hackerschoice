    This book comes highly recommended, and I can vouch for it myself. I purchased the whole ["How to talk" collection](https://amzn.to/3kvqSXR) on the strength of a Hacker News recommendation, and it's already helped me with my three year old.

    The original book focuses on school age children, however there's also "How to talk" books for younger kids, teens, sibling rivalry and schooling. I'm looking forward to being able to apply the lessons from the entire series as my kids grow up.

    The primary focus of the book is acknowledging your child's feelings, and working with them to find solutions to problems. The book presents many different example scenarios and stories, as well as exercises for the reader. There's often a summary at the end of each chapter containing all the vital information, which is great when you're coming back to the book having previously read it through.

    This book is so well loved that Hacker News also frequently recommends it for effecting communication [between adults](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27408120), and [at the office](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18019703)

  name: Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids
  subtitle: Bryan Caplan

  description: |
    This book focusses on how twin and adoption studies shown genetics matter much more than nurture, so parents spend too much time worrying about things they canâ€™t control. This doesn't mean don't bother trying to be a good parent, and of course objectively bad parenting _will_ have a negative impact on your child. It's more that being overly pushy or "tiger" parenting will not make your kid smarter or more successful.

    Modern parents put too much pressure on themselves to raise perfect children, especially when evidence shows it won't help their kids, and will just lead to stressed parents. Instead Caplan argues for what we all probably already know inside - children need a relaxed environment with parents who love them.

  name: Raising our Children, Raising Ourselves
  subtitle: Naomi Aldort

  description: |
    Naomi Aldort's book puts forward the simple idea that children need love and validation, rather than control and behavior modification. The result is the disappearance of power struggles and the emergence of closeness and cooperation. Aldort teaches parents how to listen effectively when children express strong feelings, and how to recover their ability to love, validate and offer comfort to their children when they, themselves, are upset.

    The basic principle is mindfulness when reacting to your child. Aldort provides tools to recognize the automatic response which is created through your generational conditioning. Once you let that thought/reaction pass, you can respond from a peaceful and present place.
