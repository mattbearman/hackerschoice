## [How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk](https://amzn.to/3jqvfV3)

_Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish_

This book comes highly recommended, and I can vouch for it myself. I purchased the whole ["How to talk" collection](https://amzn.to/3kvqSXR) on the strength of a Hacker News recommendation, and it's already helped me with my two (approaching three) year old.

The books are really aimed at kids aged three and up, with the original book focusing on school age children. There's also "How to talk" books for younger kids, teens, sibling rivalry and schooling. I'm looking forward to being able to apply the lessons from the entire series as my kids grow up.

The primary focus of the book is acknowledging your child's feelings, and working with them to find solutions to problems. The book presents many different example scenarios and stories, as well as exercises for the reader. There's often a summary at the end of each chapter containing all the vital information, which is great when you're coming back to the book having previously read it through.

This book is so well loved that Hacker News also frequently recommends it for effecting communication [between adults](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27408120), and [at the office](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18019703)

## [Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids](https://amzn.to/3DrIoVR)

_Bryan Caplan_

This book focusses on how twin and adoption studies shown genetics matter much more than nurture, so parents spend too much time worrying about things they can’t control. This doesn't mean don't bother trying to be a good parent, and of course objectively bad parenting _will_ have a negative impact on your child. It's more that being overly pushy or "tiger" parenting will not make your kid smarter or more successful.

Modern parents put too much pressure on themselves to raise perfect children, especially when evidence shows it won't help their kids, and will just lead to stressed parents. Instead Caplan argues for what we all probably already know inside - children need a relaxed environment with parents who love them.

## [Raising our Children, Raising Ourselves](https://amzn.to/3sUvj2m)

_Naomi Aldort_

Naomi Aldort is an eloquent proponent of the simple idea that children need love and validation, rather than control and behavior modification. The result is the disappearance of power struggles and the emergence of closeness and cooperation. Aldort teaches parents how to listen effectively when children express strong feelings, and how to recover their ability to love, validate and offer comfort to their children when they, themselves, are upset.

The basic principle is mindfulness when reacting to your child. The author provides tools to recognize the automatic response which is created through your generational conditioning. Once you let that thought/reaction pass, you can respond from a peaceful and present place. Your true loving response, not a conditioned response which you learned from your parents and them from their parents and all the way up the generational ladder. With this basis, the author provides a plethora of real world situations and expands on her reasoning with short, interesting case studies. I found the book wonderful and it is has very much added to the joy of raising my daughter. If you have kids, I can't recommend this book enough.

An honest, down to earth and well tested (she has coached thousands of parents with “problem” children/situations) approach to natural, respectful and long-term parenting.
Natural - working with the nature of development and needs that a human child has. Working against them takes tons of energy and produces agony.
Long-term - playing the long game instead of looking for short term fixes resulting in “parenting debt” like addiction to rewards, broken trust etc.
Raising ourselves - because parenting is about growing up and often facing beliefs, trauma and triggers associated with one’s own childhood. It is a great opportunity for self healing in the context of ending inter generational patterns.
Can’t recommend it enough. Also recommend her talks — on YouTube and via her website.
