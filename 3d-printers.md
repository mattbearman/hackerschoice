    The PRUSA MK3S seems to be universally accepted as the best affordable 3D printer. In fact, while I don't own one yet, I will be getting one on the strength of the Hacker News comments.

    The PRUSA MK3S is available pre-assembled, or as a kit. The kit is $250 cheaper than the fully assembled printer, and gives you the added bonus having a little project when it arrives.

    While the PRUSA is considered the best affordable 3D printer, at $749 it may still be out of reach for many budgets. If you're looking for something more in the $200 range, the Crealty Ender 3 is a great choice, and the only other 3D printer that has universal praise on Hacker News threads.
